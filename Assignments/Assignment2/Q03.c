3. Describe the functions of break and continue statements within loops. Illustrate their applications in various 
programming contexts.
*/

/*
Ans.
Functions of break and continue statements within a loops are to terminate loop completely and to skip the current 
iteration to next iteration respectively.

 Applications
i. break -> In a linear search , whenever we find the target element , we use break to avoid unnecessary searches to 
enhance time complexity.
ii. continue -> A program which is adding all the numbers from 1 to 100 except those which has '0' in rightmost position, 
then we can put a continue statement inside the loop before the code for adding numbers. 
if(num % 10 == 0) {continue;} sum += num
