/* Yes, the addresses before and after swapping are equal. Because whenever we declare a variable with a particular data 
type, specific size of memory block is assigned to it during compilation time. Hence, changing the value of the variable 
doesn't make any difference with its address because addressing is all about the reference from stack to heap.*/
